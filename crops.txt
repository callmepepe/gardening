Garlic Greens
*************
=How to Grow=
  --4" pot with drainage holes (yogurt containers)
  --Potting soil
  --Fill the pot with soil to about half an inch below the top of the container.
  --Individual cloves, and push each individual clove about an inch into the
    soil, pointy end up.
  --Plant about cloves close together. (2 per container)
  --Water well and place the container in a sunny spot.

=How to Harvest=
  --Once the shoots are 8-10 inches tall, clip off whatever you need with
    scissors.
  +Each clove only sprouts good greens once; to have a constant supply,
    you need to keep re-planting.

Microgreens
*************
=How to Grow=
  --Variety of seeds, such as radishes, kale, Swiss chard, beets, basil, and dill.
  -- Fill a shallow tray (no more than 2 inches deep) and fill the tray to the
    top with potting mix.
  --Moisten the soil with water.
  --Sift a thin layer of soil over the top to cover the seeds.
  --Mist or lightly water the soil daily so it remains moist;
    don’t let the soil dry out.
  +Try with plastic cover on top acting like greenhouse.

=How to Harvest=
  --Once the seedlings have grown to one or two inches in height and have about
    two sets of leaves, they’re ready to eat!
  --Hold them at the stem and use a pair of scissors to cut off the leaves,
    making sure not to cut into the root
  --Eat the microgreens right away or store them in a plastic bag in the fridge
    for up to five days.
